The following are steps I used to set up the development environment.
I  first of all installed remix and created a github account
## Writting and my first smart contract
1.I opened Remix IDE and and I navigated to the file eplorer on the interface and created folder named "myfirstsmartcontract" to get a new work space. In the folder I created a solidity file also called "simplestorage.sol" to wrte my smart contract there.
2.I started writing my smart contract by adding a licence identifier and then wrote the compiler directive version which will be used to compile my code. After that I defined my contract as "contract simplestorage"i stated a variable uint256 favoriteNumber and made it public for others  have access to it.
## Compiling my contract
I selected the solidity compiler from the sidebar and I made sure that the compiler version matches the one specicified in my solidity file and I clicked on compile i saw a green checkmark on the  solidity compiler which indicates that it was nothing wrong with my smart contract.
## Deploying my contract
I navigated to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab and clicked on deploy I tested the contact by entering values into the contract funstions and observed it's response.
## My challenges
I had problems with pushing and committing my code but with some assistance from some class mates from Hackerboost and watching YouTube tutorials it was no longer a worry.
It was an amazing and educative experience.
continuing with my smart contract,
## continuing with my smart contract, I implemented mappings,added and emitted events and utilized storage, memory and celldata
